Research
========

Kevin Ryczko is a researcher and machine-learning scientist. He obtained a **Ph.D. in Physics** from University of Ottawa (in collaboration with the National Research Council of Canada and the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence). Before that he obtained his Masters degree in modelling and computational science and Bachelor degree in Physiscs at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT, now Ontario Tech University).

🔬 Research background & contributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Early in his academic career, he conducted research on **liquid water-metal interfaces**, using *ab initio* electronic structure methods (density functional theory, first-principles molecular dynamics) to study how water behaves at metal surfaces — relevant for understanding water electrolysis and nanoscale energy/chemistry phenomena. As an undergrad, he even built a simulation package called “hashkat” to study how **online social networks** evolve, how connections form, and how information propagates.

🧑‍💻 Current role & work in AI / Materials / Drug Design
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Today, Kevin Ryczko works at SandboxAQ, where he applies **deep learning / machine learning techniques** to problems in computational chemistry, materials science, and biology. For instance, he is among the authors of a paper describing IDOLpro — a generative-AI platform for **structure-based drug design**. This AI combines diffusion models with multi-objective optimization to generate novel chemical compounds (ligands) with favorable properties like binding affinity and synthetic accessibility — potentially speeding up drug discovery. According to his work profile, his focus includes using ML to accelerate computation and design of nanoscale materials. 

🎯 Significance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Kevin Ryczko represents a growing class of scientists bridging **physics / quantum-chemistry + machine learning / generative AI**. His trajectory — from studying fundamental physical interfaces to working on AI-driven material/chemical discovery — highlights how modern research increasingly integrates traditional scientific modelling with cutting-edge AI.
