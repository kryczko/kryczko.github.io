Problem 2.2
==================

.. default-role:: math

Show that `E` must exceed the minimum value of `V(x)`, for every normalizable solution of the time-independent Schrödinger equation. What is the classical analog to this statement? *Hint*: Rewrite Equation 2.5 in the form

.. math::

   \frac{d^2 \psi}{dx^2} = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} [V(x)-E] \psi;

if `E < V_{min}`, then `\psi` and its second derivative always have the *same sign* -- argue that such a function cannot be normalized.
